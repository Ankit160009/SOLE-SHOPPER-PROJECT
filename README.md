# SOLE-SHOPPER-PROJECT 

## Description

The Sole Shopper project is a simple console-based shopping application that allows users to select and purchase shoes from three different brands: Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Users can add items to their cart, delete items from the cart, generate a bill, and proceed with payment using UPI (Unified Payments Interface).

The project consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the shopping process. The `main()` function serves as the entry point and prompts the user for their details such as name, phone number, age, and address. It then presents a menu with options to shop for shoes, view the cart, delete items from the cart, generate a bill, or quit the program. Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called to perform the desired action.

The project utilizes lists and dictionaries to store the items in the cart, including their names and prices. It also incorporates input validation to ensure that the user enters valid information and makes appropriate selections.
