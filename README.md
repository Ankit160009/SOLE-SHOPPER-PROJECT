## Description

The Sole Shopper project is a simple console-based shopping application that allows users to select and purchase shoes from three different brands: Nike, Adidas, and Puma. Users can add items to their cart, delete items from the cart, generate a bill, and proceed with payment using UPI (Unified Payments Interface).

The project consists of several functions that handle different aspects of the shopping process. The `main()` function serves as the entry point and prompts the user for their details such as name, phone number, age, and address. It then presents a menu with options to shop for shoes, view the cart, delete items from the cart, generate a bill, or quit the program. Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called to perform the desired action.

The project utilizes lists and dictionaries to store the items in the cart, including their names and prices. It also incorporates input validation to ensure that the user enters valid information and makes appropriate selections.

## Features:- 

1. User Information:
   - Users are prompted to enter their name, phone number, age, and address.
   - Validation checks are performed on the phone number and age inputs to ensure they meet the required criteria.

2. Shopping:
   - Users can choose from a menu of options to shop, add items to their cart, or delete items from their cart.
   - The available shoe brands (Nike, Adidas, Puma) are displayed, and users can select the brand they want to shop for.
   - For each brand, specific shoe models are presented, and users can choose the desired shoe model to add it to their cart.

3. Cart Management:
   - Users can view the contents of their cart, which displays the items they have added and their respective prices.
   - Users have the option to delete items from their cart by selecting the item number.

4. Bill Generation:
   - Users can generate a bill for the items in their cart, which includes a breakdown of each item's name and price.
   - The total cost of the items in the cart is calculated and displayed.

5. Payment:
   - Users are asked if they want to proceed with the payment.
   - If users choose to proceed, they are prompted to enter their UPI ID for payment.
   - A payment confirmation message is displayed, indicating the amount paid and the UPI ID used.

6. Program Exit:
   - Users can choose to quit the program at any time.
